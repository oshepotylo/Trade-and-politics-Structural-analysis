\section{Introduction}
This paper discusses how BRI policy impacts welfare in countries that participate in this project through more stable political environment, reduced trade costs, and heightened FDI flows.
Our previous paper discussed how lower transportation costs and potential China-EU FTA would increase welfare in China and EU countries. This paper accounts for GDP growth caused by greater political stability brought about by BRI. Impact of greater political stability and improved institutions on trade has been subject of research.
