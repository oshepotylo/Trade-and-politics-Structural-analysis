\section{Conclusion}

The BRI has the potential to lead to improvements in political stability, either via the development channel or soft intervention. This paper quantifies the impact of these institutional improvements in terms of welfare, where our findings support the importance of this channel. There are examples of Chinese soft intervention but it remains to be seen how formal Chinese policy will evolve. \textit{The New Type of Great Power Relations} still remains a broad narrative. However, as China pivots towards the international stage, there becomes a greater need to use soft power to protect investments.
